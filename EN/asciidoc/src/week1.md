# Basic ideas

```
a software design architecture to process all the info related to heat fee, including functions of collecting info from sensors, managing when the resident moves out, charging fees etc. Interact mainly with two types of user, resident as normal users and managers and system maintainers as admins

| **Actors**               | Tenant, Property Manager             |
| **Description**          | This use case involves recording and charging heating fees for rented houses. The system tracks the usage of heating resources in a house and calculates the corresponding fees for the tenant. |
| **Preconditions**        | 1. Tenant has an active rental agreement. 2. The heating system is installed and operational. |
| **Postconditions**       | 1. Heating fees are recorded for the specified period. 2. Tenant receives a bill for the heating charges. |
| **Invariants**           | None                                   |
| **Basic Workflow**       | 1. Tenant adjusts the heating preferences. 2. System records heating resource consumption. 3. System calculates heating fees based on usage. 4. Tenant receives a bill for the heating charges. |
| **Alternative Workflow**  | - If the heating system malfunctions, notify property manager and suspend fee calculation until the issue is resolved. - If tenant disputes the heating charges, initiate a review process and adjust fees if necessary. |
| **Risks**                | 1. Malfunction of heating system. 2. Disputes between tenant and property manager regarding fee calculation. |
| **Quality Goals**        | 1. Accuracy in calculating heating fees. 2. Timely generation and delivery of heating fee bills. |
| **Special Requirements** | 1. The system should support multiple methods of heating (e.g., central heating, electric heating) for accurate fee calculation. 2. Heating fee bills should be clear and itemized for easy understanding by the tenant. |
| **Assumptions**          | 1. Tenants are responsible for their heating charges as per the rental agreement. 2. The heating system is equipped with meters or sensors to measure consumption accurately. |

| **Postconditions**       | 1. The new tenant's information is added to the system. 2. The rental agreement is generated and stored. |
| **Invariants**           | None                        |
| **Basic Workflow**       | 1. Landlord logs into the property management system. 2. Landlord accesses the "New Tenant Registration" feature. 3. Landlord enters the new tenant's information (name, contact details, etc.). 4. Landlord specifies the terms of the rental agreement (duration, rent amount, etc.). 5. System validates the information provided. 6. System generates a unique identifier for the new tenant and stores their details. 7. System generates a rental agreement document. 8. Landlord reviews and confirms the registration. |
| **Alternative Workflow**  | - If the information provided is incomplete or invalid, the system prompts the landlord to correct the details. - If the rental agreement terms need negotiation, the landlord can enter a negotiation phase with the new tenant. |
| **Risks**                | 1. Incomplete or inaccurate tenant information. 2. Miscommunication regarding rental agreement terms. |
| **Quality Goals**        | 1. Accurate and complete recording of tenant information. 2. Efficient generation and storage of rental agreements. |
| **Special Requirements** | 1. The system should support the attachment of legal documents related to the rental agreement. 2. Notifications should be sent to both the landlord and the new tenant upon successful registration. |
| **Assumptions**          | 1. The landlord has the legal authority to rent out the property. 2. The property is in a suitable condition for occupancy. |

| **Postconditions**       | 1. Communication with the tenant regarding the rent delay is documented. 2. A plan for resolution is agreed upon, which may include late fees or a revised payment schedule. |
| **Invariants**           | None                                |
| **Basic Workflow**       | 1. Property manager receives a notification or identifies that a tenant's rent is overdue. 2. Property manager accesses tenant information in the property management system. 3. Property manager initiates communication with the tenant through the system, inquiring about the reason for the delay. 4. Tenant responds with the reason for the delay. 5. Property manager reviews the situation and determines appropriate actions, which may include imposing late fees or negotiating a new payment schedule. 6. Property manager updates the system with the details of the communication and any agreed-upon resolution. 7. If the issue persists, the property manager may escalate the matter following the established protocol. |
| **Alternative Workflow**  | - If the tenant provides a valid reason for the delay (e.g., unexpected financial hardship), the property manager may work with the tenant to establish a temporary solution. - If the tenant is unresponsive, the property manager may escalate the issue by sending formal notices or involving legal channels as per the rental agreement. |
| **Risks**                | 1. Miscommunication between the property manager and tenant. 2. Tenant disputes regarding late fees or resolution terms. |
| **Quality Goals**        | 1. Timely and clear communication regarding rent delays. 2. Fair and consistent application of policies for resolving rent delays. |
