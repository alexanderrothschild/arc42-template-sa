== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****
endif::arc42help[]

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
****
endif::arc42help[]

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.

| _Customer_ | _<Landlord>_ | _1. What is your business? What are you doing? +
                                Answer: +
                                2. What challenges you want to solve throughout the project? +
                                3. Are there any existing systems that need to be integrated? +
                                4. What is your product and for whom is it? Who is your target audience? +
                                5. Is it important for you what technologies are going to be used by us? +
                                6. What are the project risks for your company? +
                                7. What yre the deadlines? Till what time what should be ready? +
                                8. If it is a REST app do your have the REST endpoints or should we develop them on your side?
                                9. What is the projects budget? +
                                10. How many people are there in the project and how many you need? +
                                11. Are there any software architecture constraints that we should know about (architectural pattern or design pattern)? +
                                12. Ask about that: the building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules,
                                components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions,
                                macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...) +
                                13. Make sure that we know:
                                * important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
                                * interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
                                * operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
                                * error and exception scenarios +
                                14. What is your technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical
                                locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and
                                mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements. +
                                15. Do you have production/test systems, should we build them?_
| _<Role-2>_ | _<Contact-2>_ | 1. _What is your business? What are you doing?_ +
                                Answer: +
                                2.
