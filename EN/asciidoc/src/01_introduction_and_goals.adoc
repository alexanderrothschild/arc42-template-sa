Housing system is an administrative system for a landlord that rents houses.
It's main goals are to facilitate the landlord to administrate the followings:
* rental objects
* tennants
* service charge billings
The project should also give the tennants a portal to check their daily consumptions of heating energy and water.
...

This is a project of Alexander Rothschild, Hantao Zhou, Marco Campione.

=== Requirements Overview

.Contents
The main purpose of Housing system is keeping track of all the rental objects, tennants informations, billings, consumptions and sensor management so that the landlord has all the informations updated.
Another purpose is to create a portal for the tennants to pat for the rent and the services

.Motivation
The landlord asked for a system that helps him to keep track of everything he think it's important for the administration of his rental objects. He asked for this project because right now he is working with Excel sheets and he is keeping every information updated "manually". This project aims to shift this manual work to an automated system.

=== Basic ideas and Brainstorming

A software design architecture to process all the info related to heat fee, including functions of collecting info from sensors, managing when the resident moves out, charging fees etc. Interact mainly with two types of user, resident as normal users and managers and system maintainers as admins.

We used mermaid to create a diagram Create a coarse boxes and arrows diagram (only most basic components) to give yourself a better first overview of the system’s requirements.

|*Use Case ID and Name* |UC001 - Record and Charge Heating Fees
|*Actors* |Tenant, Property Manager

|*Description* |This use case involves recording and charging heating
fees for rented houses. The system tracks the usage of heating resources
in a house and calculates the corresponding fees for the tenant.

|*Preconditions* |1. Tenant has an active rental agreement. 2. The
heating system is installed and operational.

|*Postconditions* |1. Heating fees are recorded for the specified
period. 2. Tenant receives a bill for the heating charges.

|*Invariants* |None

|*Basic Workflow* |1. Tenant adjusts the heating preferences. 2. System
records heating resource consumption. 3. System calculates heating fees
based on usage. 4. Tenant receives a bill for the heating charges.

|*Alternative Workflow* |- If the heating system malfunctions, notify
property manager and suspend fee calculation until the issue is
resolved. - If tenant disputes the heating charges, initiate a review
process and adjust fees if necessary.

|*Risks* |1. Malfunction of heating system. 2. Disputes between tenant
and property manager regarding fee calculation.

|*Quality Goals* |1. Accuracy in calculating heating fees. 2. Timely
generation and delivery of heating fee bills.

|*Special Requirements* |1. The system should support multiple methods
of heating (e.g., central heating, electric heating) for accurate fee
calculation. 2. Heating fee bills should be clear and itemized for easy
understanding by the tenant.

|*Assumptions* |1. Tenants are responsible for their heating charges as
per the rental agreement. 2. The heating system is equipped with meters
or sensors to measure consumption accurately.

|*Use Case ID and Name* |UC002 - Register New Tenant
|*Actors* |Landlord, New Tenant

|*Description* |This use case involves the landlord registering a new
tenant in the system when a property is rented out to a new occupant.

|*Preconditions* |1. The landlord is logged into the property management
system. 2. The property is available for rent.

|*Postconditions* |1. The new tenant’s information is added to the
system. 2. The rental agreement is generated and stored.

|*Invariants* |None

|*Basic Workflow* |1. Landlord logs into the property management system.
2. Landlord accesses the ``New Tenant Registration'' feature. 3.
Landlord enters the new tenant’s information (name, contact details,
etc.). 4. Landlord specifies the terms of the rental agreement
(duration, rent amount, etc.). 5. System validates the information
provided. 6. System generates a unique identifier for the new tenant and
stores their details. 7. System generates a rental agreement document.
8. Landlord reviews and confirms the registration.

|*Alternative Workflow* |- If the information provided is incomplete or
invalid, the system prompts the landlord to correct the details. - If
the rental agreement terms need negotiation, the landlord can enter a
negotiation phase with the new tenant.

|*Risks* |1. Incomplete or inaccurate tenant information. 2.
Miscommunication regarding rental agreement terms.

|*Quality Goals* |1. Accurate and complete recording of tenant
information. 2. Efficient generation and storage of rental agreements.

|*Special Requirements* |1. The system should support the attachment of
legal documents related to the rental agreement. 2. Notifications should
be sent to both the landlord and the new tenant upon successful
registration.

|*Assumptions* |1. The landlord has the legal authority to rent out the
property. 2. The property is in a suitable condition for occupancy.

|*Use Case ID and Name* |UC003 - Handle Tenant Rent Delay
|*Actors* |Property Manager, Tenant

|*Description* |This use case involves the property manager addressing a
situation where a tenant is delaying on paying rent. The goal is to
initiate communication and resolve the issue in a timely and fair
manner.

|*Preconditions* |1. Tenant has not paid the rent on the due date. 2.
Property manager is logged into the property management system.

|*Postconditions* |1. Communication with the tenant regarding the rent
delay is documented. 2. A plan for resolution is agreed upon, which may
include late fees or a revised payment schedule.

|*Invariants* |None

|*Basic Workflow* |1. Property manager receives a notification or
identifies that a tenant’s rent is overdue. 2. Property manager accesses
tenant information in the property management system. 3. Property
manager initiates communication with the tenant through the system,
inquiring about the reason for the delay. 4. Tenant responds with the
reason for the delay. 5. Property manager reviews the situation and
determines appropriate actions, which may include imposing late fees or
negotiating a new payment schedule. 6. Property manager updates the
system with the details of the communication and any agreed-upon
resolution. 7. If the issue persists, the property manager may escalate
the matter following the established protocol.

|*Alternative Workflow* |- If the tenant provides a valid reason for the
delay (e.g., unexpected financial hardship), the property manager may
work with the tenant to establish a temporary solution. - If the tenant
is unresponsive, the property manager may escalate the issue by sending
formal notices or involving legal channels as per the rental agreement.

|*Risks* |1. Miscommunication between the property manager and tenant.
2. Tenant disputes regarding late fees or resolution terms.

|*Quality Goals* |1. Timely and clear communication regarding rent
delays. 2. Fair and consistent application of policies for resolving
rent delays.

|*Special Requirements* |1. The system should support the documentation
of all communication related to rent delays. 2. Notifications to both
parties should be clear and provide relevant information.

|*Assumptions* |1. The rental agreement includes terms and policies
regarding rent payments and late fees. 2. Both parties are expected to
communicate through the system for transparency.

minimize disruption. - If the update reveals unforeseen issues or
conflicts, the system administrator may need to roll back the changes
and investigate the cause before reapplying the update.

|*Risks* |1. Potential system downtime during the update. 2. Unforeseen
issues or conflicts arising from the security update.

|*Quality Goals* |1. Minimize system downtime during security updates.
