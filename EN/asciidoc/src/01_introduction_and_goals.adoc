This is a project of Alexander Rothschild and Marco Campione.

_Housing system_ is an administrative system for a landlord that rents houses.
It's main goals are to facilitate the landlord to administrate the followings:
* rental objects
* tenants
* service charge billings
The project should also give the tenants a portal to check their daily consumptions of heating energy and water.

We'd like to thank our teachers Marion Wiese and Prof. Dr. André van Hoorn.

=== Requirements Overview

.What is Housing system?
The main purpose of _Housing system_ is keeping track of all the rental objects, tenants information, billings, consumptions and sensor management so that the landlord has all the informations updated.
Another purpose is to create a portal for the tenants to pat for the rent and the services

.Motivation
The landlord asked for a system that helps him to keep track of everything he thinks it's important for the administration of his rental objects. He asked for this project because right now he is working with Excel sheets and he is keeping every information updated "manually". This project aims to shift this manual work to an automated system.

=== Basic ideas and Brainstorming

A software design architecture to process all the info related to heat fee, including functions of collecting info from sensors, managing when the resident moves out, charging fees etc. Interact mainly with two types of user, resident as normal users and managers and system maintainers as admins.

We used _Mermaid_ to create a diagram consisting of coarse boxes and arrows (only most basic components) to give ourselves a better first overview of the system's requirements.

2. Landlord accesses the ``New Tenant Registration'' feature. 3.
Landlord enters the new tenant’s information (name, contact details,
etc.). 4. Landlord specifies the terms of the rental agreement
(duration, rent amount, etc.). 5. System validates the information
provided. 6. System generates a unique identifier for the new tenant and
stores their details. 7. System generates a rental agreement document.
8. Landlord reviews and confirms the registration.

|*Alternative Workflow* |- If the information provided is incomplete or
invalid, the system prompts the landlord to correct the details. - If
the rental agreement terms need negotiation, the landlord can enter a
negotiation phase with the new tenant.

|*Risks* |1. Incomplete or inaccurate tenant information. 2.
Miscommunication regarding rental agreement terms.

|*Quality Goals* |1. Accurate and complete recording of tenant
information. 2. Efficient generation and storage of rental agreements.

tenant information in the property management system. 3. Property
manager initiates communication with the tenant through the system,
inquiring about the reason for the delay. 4. Tenant responds with the
reason for the delay. 5. Property manager reviews the situation and
determines appropriate actions, which may include imposing late fees or
negotiating a new payment schedule. 6. Property manager updates the
system with the details of the communication and any agreed-upon
resolution. 7. If the issue persists, the property manager may escalate
the matter following the established protocol.

|*Alternative Workflow* |- If the tenant provides a valid reason for the
delay (e.g., unexpected financial hardship), the property manager may
work with the tenant to establish a temporary solution. - If the tenant
is unresponsive, the property manager may escalate the issue by sending
formal notices or involving legal channels as per the rental agreement.

|*Risks* |1. Miscommunication between the property manager and tenant.
2. Tenant disputes regarding late fees or resolution terms.
