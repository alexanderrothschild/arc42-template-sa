image::C4 Model Deployment Diagram for Housing System.jpg[]

Microservices architecture is a design approach where a software application is structured as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other through well-defined APIs. While microservices based architecture is known for its scalability and flexibility, it also comes with its own set of pros and cons.

==== Benefits:

1. **Scalability:** Microservices can be independently scaled, allowing specific services to handle varying workloads.
2. **Flexibility:** Teams can develop and deploy services independently, enabling faster development cycles and updates.
3. **Technological Diversity:** Each microservice can be developed using different technologies, allowing teams to choose the best tools for each specific task.

==== Drawbacks:

1. **Complexity:** Managing a distributed system with multiple services introduces complexity in terms of deployment, monitoring, and debugging.
2. **Latency:** Communication between microservices can introduce network latency compared to monolithic architectures.
3. **Data Consistency:** Maintaining consistency across multiple databases can be challenging, leading to potential data synchronization issues.

==== Risks:

1. **Data Management:** 
- **Issue:** Microservices often have their own databases, which can lead to challenges in maintaining data consistency across services.
- **Mitigation:** Implement strategies like eventual consistency, use distributed transactions carefully, and employ techniques such as API gateways or event-driven architectures to handle data synchronization.
2. **Service Discovery and Communication:** 
- **Issue:** Dynamic service discovery and communication between microservices can introduce latency and network-related issues.
- **Mitigation:** Use service mesh solutions, API gateways, and appropriate protocols to manage service discovery and communication. Implement retries and timeouts to handle transient failures.
3. **Security Concerns:** 
- **Issue:** Microservices architecture introduces additional attack vectors, and securing communication between services is crucial.
- **Mitigation:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) and regularly update security practices and policies.

=== Service-Oriented Architecture (Alternative Solution)
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that involves organizing software systems as a set of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. It has a better maintainability compared to a full monolithic architecture, and also is not completely separated compared to a microservices architecture. While SOA has several benefits for our solution, it also comes with its set of challenges.

==== Benefits:

1. **Reusability and Modularity:** SOA promotes the development of modular and reusable services. Each service encapsulates a specific functionality and can be reused in different parts of an application or across different applications. This improves development efficiency and reduces redundancy.

2. **Interoperability:** SOA facilitates interoperability between different software systems and technologies. Services communicate using standard protocols and can be implemented in various programming languages. This enables organizations to integrate diverse systems.

3. **Flexibility:** The flexibility is particularly valuable in dynamic environments where the demand for certain services may vary. It also facilitates easier adaptation to changes and updates in technology or business requirements.

==== Drawbacks:

1. **Complexity and Overhead:** Implementing and managing a service-oriented architecture can introduce complexity. Services need to be designed, deployed, and orchestrated properly. Additionally, the overhead of managing service discovery, communication, and security can be challenging, particularly in large and distributed systems.

2. **Performance Concerns:** The communication between services, often over a network, introduces latency compared to in-process calls. This can impact the overall performance of the system, especially if poorly designed or if services are distributed across geographically dispersed locations. Efficient communication and data transfer mechanisms are crucial to mitigating this drawback.

3. **Security Challenges:** Managing security in a SOA environment can be complex. Services may need to authenticate and authorize requests, and securing communication between services is essential. Additionally, ensuring compliance with governance policies, such as version control and service contracts, requires careful planning and implementation.

==== Risks:

1. **Dependency Management:**
   - **Issue:** Changes in one service may impact other dependent services, leading to potential disruptions.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement version control for services and use service registries to manage dependencies. Define clear service contracts and communication protocols. Establish change management processes to assess the impact of modifications before deployment. Employ automated testing and continuous integration practices to catch integration issues early.

2. **Service Availability and Reliability:**
   - **Issue:** Services may experience downtime, affecting the overall system availability.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for critical services. Use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances of a service. Regularly monitor and perform testing to identify and address potential points of failure.

3. **Data Security and Privacy:**
   - **Issue:** Sharing data between services may lead to security vulnerabilities or unauthorized access.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Encrypt sensitive data during transmission and storage. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities. Define and enforce data access policies.

4. **Performance Bottlenecks:**
   - **Issue:** Increased complexity in a distributed system may lead to performance bottlenecks and degraded response times.
   - **Mitigation:** Conduct performance testing to identify and optimize bottlenecks. Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data. Utilize content delivery networks (CDNs) for static content. Monitor system performance in real-time and scale infrastructure as needed.
