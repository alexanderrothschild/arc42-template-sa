== Context and Scope

.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

This chapter describes the environment and context of _Housing system_: Who uses the system and on which other system does _Housing system_ depend.

=== Business Context

.Business context diagram

* _Tennant_: A person that uses _Housing system_ to manage his house payments, consumptions, personal data and documents, etc.

* _Landlord_: The person that uses _Housing system_ to manage his rental objects (houses), his tenants, the service charge billings, IoI devices, etc.

* _Bank Account_

* _IoT Devices_

.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
